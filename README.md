Ainok is an opensource reference Quiz application. You can use this application as the base to build any full fledged 
quizzing application. 

How to Use:

2. Update your MySQL credentials in the 'applicationContext.xml' present in the 'WebContent/WEB-INF' folder. 
3. Build the war file and deploy it in the Tomcat Server. Now, you should be able to access the app from the browser.
